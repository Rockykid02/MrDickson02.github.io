      <h1>White Hat Hackers</h1>
      <p> White hat hackers, also known as ethical hackers, are hackers who use their skills for positive or ethical purposes. They may be hired by companies to test their systems for vulnerabilities, or they may hack systems as a way to expose security flaws so that they can be fixed. White hat hackers operate within the law, and with the permission of the system owners. They often use the same techniques as black hat hackers, but with the goal of improving security rather than causing harm</p>
      <h3>Grey Hat Hackers</h3> 
      <p>These are Hybrib between Black and White Hackers ..Grey hat hackers, sometimes called "hacktivists,"  They may hack systems without permission, but they typically don't have malicious intent.
